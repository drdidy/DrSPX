### SPX Anchor Trading Rules ⚓

#### RTH Anchor Breaks
* **30-min close below RTH entry anchor** → Price may retrace above anchor line but **will fall below again shortly after**
* **Don't chase the bounce** — prepare for the inevitable breakdown

#### Extended Hours Behavior  
* **Price falls below SPX anchor in extended session** → If price rises back above same anchor → **Use that anchor as buy signal in RTH**
* Extended session weakness followed by recovery = RTH strength setup

#### Monday/Wednesday/Friday Anchor Touch Rule
* **No touch of high, close, or low anchor points** on Mon/Wed/Fri → **Potential sell day later in session**
* **Don't trade TO the anchor** — let the market give you the entry
* **Wait for price action confirmation** rather than anticipating anchor touches

#### Anchor Trading Psychology
* **Patience over precision** — anchors are magnets, not timing signals
* **Failed anchor tests** often lead to explosive moves in opposite direction
* **Extended session anchors** carry forward momentum into RTH

### Tuesday contract play  
* Identify **two overnight option low points that rise \$400–\$500 **.  
* Use them to set the Tuesday contract slope (handled in the SPX tab).

### Thursday contract play  
* If **Wednesday's low premium was cheap** → Thursday low ≈ Wed low (**buy-day**).  
* If **Wednesday stayed pricey** → Thursday likely a **put-day** (avoid longs).

### Risk Management Enhancements 🛡️

#### Position Sizing Rules
* **Never risk more than 2% per trade** — consistency beats home runs
* **Scale into positions** — 1/3 initial, 1/3 on confirmation, 1/3 on momentum
* **Reduce size on Fridays** — weekend risk isn't worth it

#### Stop Loss Strategy
* **Hard stops at -15%** for options (no exceptions)
* **Trailing stops after +25%** — protect profits aggressively
* **Time stops at 3:45 PM** — avoid close volatility unless holding overnight

#### Market Context Awareness
* **VIX above 25** → Reduce position sizes by 50%
* **Major earnings week** → Avoid unrelated tickers (sympathy moves)
* **FOMC/CPI days** → Trade post-announcement only (10:30+ AM)

### Advanced Entry Techniques 🎯

#### Volume Confirmation
* **Entry volume > 20-day average** → Strong conviction signal
* **Declining volume on bounces** → Fade the move
* **Volume spike + anchor break** → High probability setup

#### Time-Based Patterns
* **9:30-10:00 AM** → Initial range, avoid FOMO entries
* **10:30-11:30 AM** → Institutional flow window, best entries
* **2:00-3:00 PM** → Final push time, momentum plays
* **3:30+ PM** → Scalps only, avoid new positions

#### Multi-Timeframe Alignment
* **5-min + 15-min + 1-hour** all pointing same direction = high conviction
* **Conflicting timeframes** = wait for resolution
* **Daily anchor + intraday setup** = strongest edge

### Psychological Rules 🧠

#### Emotional Discipline  
* **3 losses in a row** → Step away for 1 hour minimum
* **Big win euphoria** → Reduce next position size by 50%
* **Revenge trading** → Automatic day-end (no exceptions)

#### Daily Routine
* **Pre-market prep** → Review overnight anchors + news
* **Mid-day reset** → 12:00 PM evaluation of P&L and plan
* **Post-market review** → Log what worked/didn't work

#### Performance Tracking
* **Win rate target: 55%+** (more important than individual trade size)
* **Risk/reward minimum: 1:1.5** (risk $100 to make $150+)
* **Weekly P&L cap** → Stop trading after +20% or -10% weekly moves

### Golden rules 🔔  
* **Exit levels are exits — never entries.**  
* **SPX ignores the full 16:00 – 17:00 maintenance block.**
* **Anchors are magnets, not timing signals — let price come to you.**
* **The market will give you your entry — don't force it.**
* **Consistency in process trumps perfection in prediction.**
* **When in doubt, stay out — there's always another trade.**
