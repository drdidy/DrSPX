# ===== TRADING RULES & STRATEGIES =====
SPX_GOLDEN_RULES = [
    "🎯 Exit levels are exits - never entries",
    "🧲 Anchors are magnets, not timing signals - let price come to you", 
    "⏰ The market will give you your entry - don't force it",
    "📊 Consistency in process trumps perfection in prediction",
    "🤔 When in doubt, stay out - there's always another trade",
    "🚫 SPX ignores the full 16:00-17:00 maintenance block",
]

SPX_ANCHOR_RULES = {
    "rth_breaks": [
        "📉 30-min close below RTH entry anchor: price may retrace above anchor line but will fall below again shortly after",
        "🚀 Don't chase the bounce: prepare for the inevitable breakdown", 
        "✅ Wait for confirmation: let the market give you the entry",
    ],
    "extended_hours": [
        "🌙 Extended session weakness + recovery: use recovered anchor as buy signal in RTH",
        "⚡ Extended session anchors carry forward momentum into regular trading hours",
        "📈 Extended bounce of anchors carry forward momentum into regular trading hours", 
        "🌅 Overnight anchor recovery: strong setup for next day strength",
    ],
    "mon_wed_fri": [
        "📅 No touch of high, close, or low anchors on Mon/Wed/Fri = potential sell day later",

        "⏳ Wait for price action confirmation rather than anticipating touches",
    ],
    "fibonacci_bounce": [
        "🎯 SPX Line Touch + Bounce: when SPX price touches line and bounces, contract follows the same pattern",
        "📐 0.786 Fibonacci Entry: contract retraces to 0.786 fib level (low to high of bounce) = major algo entry point",
        "⏰ Next Hour Candle: the 0.786 retracement typically occurs in the NEXT hour candle, not the same one", 
        "🎪 High Probability: algos consistently enter at 0.786 level for profitable runs",
        "✨ Setup Requirements: clear bounce off SPX line + identifiable low-to-high swing for fib calculation",

    "thursday_play": [

        "📊 Entry volume > 20-day average: strong conviction signal",

    ],
    "multi_timeframe": [
        "🎯 5-min + 15-min + 1-hour all pointing same direction = high conviction",
